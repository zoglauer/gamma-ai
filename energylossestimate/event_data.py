"""Contains EventData class to store simulation data in standardized format.

Dependencies: numpy

EventData: main class.
__init__(self): constructor for EventData.
print(self): prints contents of instance of EventData.

Used in event_extractor.py, which does the actual processing of simulation
data. Resulting processed data, consisting of instances of EventData, is stored
to a file that is later imported to energy_estimate.py as training/testing
data for neural network models in that file.
